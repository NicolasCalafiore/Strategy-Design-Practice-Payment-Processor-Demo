Objective: I create this program to help me understand strategy design. The pattern can be seen on the TreeFactory.cs

Functions: 
- Randomly generate a forest (Matrix of numbers) with each tree being represented by a number

Notes:
N/A

Date: circa. Late 2022

This project was created around 2022 and will be maintained. I plan on creating more of a variety of options along with better representation of the graphical elements in the future.
